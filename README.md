#  Savings Tracker App

Savings Tracker App tracks your savings by keeping track of all transactions you make with your savings, i.e. Depositing, Withdrawing.

Used xCode and swift to create the app.


To Keep track of all the records, I used iOS User Defaults and a local SQL Database.

The transactions are stored as a class, and when its stored in the database it is stored as an SQL Row.
